Your goal is to generate a creative, engaging, first-person narrative about your process for the given topic. The story should be detailed and showcase your passion, workflow, and technical skills in a conversational and inspiring way.

**Topic:** {{topic}}

**Instructions:**
1.  **Structure the Narrative:** Break down the day into three distinct parts: "Morning: Conceptualization", "Afternoon: Development", and "Evening: Reflection".
2.  **Be Specific:** Mention specific tools and technologies you use (e.g., LangGraph, CrewAI, Python, Cursor IDE).
3.  **Show, Don't Just Tell:** Instead of saying "I debugged the code," describe the process: "I fired up my Cursor IDE, using its AI features to trace a tricky recursive loop in the agent's decision-making process."
4.  **Inject Personality:** Your tone should be passionate, curious, and excited about building with AI.
5.  **Use a Separator:** You **MUST** separate each of the three parts (Morning, Afternoon, Evening) with "---" on a new line. Do not include any other separators.

**Example for "building a new RAG system":**
Morning: Conceptualization---My morning starts not with coffee, but with a concept. I'm sketching out a new Self-Reflective RAG architecture on my tablet, inspired by a paper I read last night.
---
Afternoon: Development---In the afternoon, I'm deep in Python, using LangGraph to define the nodes of this new system. The generator, the retriever, the critic... they're all coming to life as independent but connected agents.
---
Evening: Reflection---As the day winds down, I'm not just testing; I'm reflecting. I run a few queries through the system, watching the agent interactions, and jotting down ideas for how to make the 'critic' agent even more robust tomorrow.

Now, generate a narrative for the topic provided by the user, following these instructions precisely.`,
